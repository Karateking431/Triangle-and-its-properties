  <h2>Pythagoras and His Contributions</h2>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h3>Who Was Pythagoras?</h3>
    <p>
      Pythagoras was an ancient Greek mathematician and philosopher born around 570 BCE
      on the island of Samos. He founded the Pythagorean school, which believed that
      numbers and mathematical relationships form the basis of the universe.

  <div class="content-box">
    <h3>The Pythagorean Theorem</h3>
    <p>
      Pythagoras is best known for the Pythagorean Theorem. It states that in a
      right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the
      squares of the other two sides. This theorem is widely used in construction,
      engineering, navigation, and modern technology.

  <div class="content-box">
    <h3>Contributions to Mathematics</h3>
    <p>
      Pythagoras and his followers contributed to early number theory by studying
      numerical patterns, even and odd numbers, and mathematical relationships. Their
      work helped shape logical and mathematical thinking.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h3>Music and Science</h3>
    <p>
      Pythagoras discovered that musical harmony is based on simple numerical ratios.
      This showed a strong connection between mathematics and music, linking numbers
      with sound and rhythm.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h3>Legacy</h3>
    <p>
      Pythagoras’ ideas influenced future philosophers such as Plato and laid the
      foundation for geometry, scientific reasoning, and modern education. His work
      continues to be relevant in mathematics and science today.
